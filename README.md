"Space Invaders" is a classic arcade game released in 1978 by Taito. It was one of the earliest shooting games and remains a significant and influential title in the video game industry. In the game, players control a ship that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen, and they must shoot down waves of approaching alien invaders before they reach the bottom. The game's simple yet addictive gameplay and iconic pixelated alien sprites have made it a classic in the gaming world.
